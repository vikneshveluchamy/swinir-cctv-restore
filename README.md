⭐ SwinIR-Based CCTV Image Restoration & Super Resolution
AI-powered enhancement for low-quality images using Vision Transformers

🔗 Live Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vikneshveluchamy/swinir-super-resolution

🔥 Overview

This project performs CCTV image enhancement, combining:

🧽 Denoising (cleaning grain + distortion)

🔍 ×4 Super Resolution (improving clarity + detail)

🌐 Interactive Gradio Web App

🧠 SwinIR Transformer Model trained for Real-World Image Restoration

Designed specifically for noisy, blurred, or low-light CCTV images.

🚀 Features

✔️ Real-world ×4 super resolution
✔️ Noise removal & detail restoration
✔️ Works with CCTV, low-light indoor, noisy video frames
✔️ Completely browser-based (runs on Hugging Face)
✔️ Clean, simple UI for non-technical users
